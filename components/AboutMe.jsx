        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Greetings! I'm a curious and proactive Front-end Developer with a strong focus on React and Agile practices.

        <h3>What moves me</h3>
            <p>I found my passion for front-end development when I realized how much I cared for all the pixels, the
            aesthetics, and the little details when developing beautiful UI and projects. Through experience, I've learned that flexibility, mutual respect and teamwork are the keys to success, and I'm ready to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
            Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your team. ðŸ˜Š</p>
