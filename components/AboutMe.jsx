        <p>I'm a Front-end Developer with a curious and proactive mindset. I found my passion
            for front-end development when I realized how much I cared for all the pixels, the
            aesthetics, and the little details when developing beautiful UI and projects.
            In addition, my experience as a Digital Project Manager made me a strong team player,
            with excellent communication and a sense of ownership on all projects I work on.
